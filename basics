ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Linearity: The linearity assumption is that the effects of a number of variables (transformed or untransformed, i.e., it can include square-root or square of a feature, ie feature raised to any power) add up and lead to a model with normally and independently, randomly scattered residuals.
    Y = a + (b1* X1) + (b2*X2^2) + â€¦
    Although, X2 is raised to power 2, the equation is still linear in parameters.

2. No multi-collinearity: No linear relationship b/w the independent variables.
3. The variance of independent variables should be positive: The independent variables should not have equal variance, and should always be positive.
4. Mean of residuals shold be zero: Residual (or error) is the difference between actual value and predicted value. The sum of residuals should be zero or near zero, therefore mean will also be zero.
5. No auto correlation between the residuals: Auto-correlation means residuals (errors) are not independent of each other.
6. Residuals must be normally distributed: When we plot the residuals with the number of values, ie, frequency, it is normally distributed.
7. Homoscedasticity:
